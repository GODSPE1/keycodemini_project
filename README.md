# KeyCode Mini Project

A simple vanilla JavaScript project created as part of a JavaScript course to practice fundamental concepts.

## Project Description

This application listens for keyboard events and displays the `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` properties of the key that was pressed. It's a classic exercise for beginners to get hands-on experience with JavaScript events and manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM).

When a user presses any key, the screen updates to show the details of that key event.

## Learning Objectives

This project focuses on the following concepts:

*   **JavaScript Events**: Attaching and handling `keydown` events using `window.addEventListener`.
*   **DOM Manipulation**:
    *   Selecting elements from the DOM using `document.getElementById`.
    *   Creating new HTML elements dynamically with `document.createElement`.
    *   Adding content to elements using `createTextNode` and `appendChild`.
    *   Modifying element properties like `className`.
    *   Clearing existing content of an element.
*   **JavaScript Fundamentals**:
    *   Working with objects to store and iterate over data.
    *   Using loops (`for...in`) to process data.
    *   Conditional logic (ternary operator).

## How to Use

1.  Download or clone the project files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  Press any key on your keyboard.
4.  The corresponding event key codes will be displayed on the page.

## Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
*   `keycode.js`: The core JavaScript file that contains the logic for event handling and DOM manipulation.
